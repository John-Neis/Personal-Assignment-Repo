HW-11	CS230		10 points	Due: Monday, December 3

On December 3, 1949, "Ozzy" Osbourne, also known as The Prince of 
Darkness, was born. Hopefully, this assignment will not be very scary.

Write a program that uses a pointer-based linked list. You should 
use the following struct (declared as a global):

   struct node {
      char name[10];
      struct node *next;
   };

Note that no other variables can be global.

To populate your linked list open the hw11.data file and read in the 
contents. The file format is as follows: name op_code
  For example:
  Vlad a
  Cullen a
  Morticia a
  Ophelia a
  Smurf a
  Morticia d

The name will be a string. The op_code will be a character ('a' or 'd'), 
where 'a' indicates that you should add this person to the linked-list, 
'd' indicates that you should delete this person from the linked-list. 
Note that when you add a person you must add them in increasing order. I.e.
we are adding them as an insertion sort (no, you cannot presort the list). 
This MUST be seperate functions (adding and deleting).

You also need to provide output that proves your program works. After 
the last data item has been processed, your program must display the 
contents of the linked-list. This MUST be a seperate function.

Your program must also correctly free all links of the list on termination. 
This MUST be a seperate function.

Hmmm. Here's a thought. Since the struct char name can only hold 10 
characters, how would you prevent a buffer overflow?

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Linux Mint in Leonard 110 or 112.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw11-yourname.c
