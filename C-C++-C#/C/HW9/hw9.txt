HW-9	CS230		20 points	Due: November 5, 2018

On this date in 1725 Spain & Austria signed a secret treaty, 
but it's a secret so nobody knows why.

Write a program that opens a file of integers and generates
a BINARY tree using that data. The file format will be one
integer per line. The file will be called hw9.data. You do not
know how big the file will be so you will need to create a
dynamic array to hold the data. You will also need to sort 
the data and then parse it using the recursive function I
showed in class. 

As you generate the tree you must also create a linked list
that POINTS to the same nodes.

Your code must do a pre-, in-, and post-order traversal of
the tree and a traversal of the linked list. These must be
four seperate functions.

Your program must also correctly free all links of the TREE
and LIST on termination (note that with the extra linked list
this should be very easy). This MUST be a seperate function.

You have all of the code you need in your class notes. You 
just need to figure out to combine them.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Linux Mint.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning 
   of your program.

3. Your source code must be named hw9-yourname.c
